This vignette will guide you through the post analysis of the results obtained from the HDAnalyzeR pipeline. The post analysis consists of two possible steps: pathway enrichment analysis and automated literature search. The pathway enrichment analysis is performed using the Gene Ontology, KEGG and Reactome databases from `clusterProfiler` and `ReactomePA` packages respectively. The automated literature search is performed using the the PubMed database.

## Loading the Data

We will load HDAnalyzeR and dplyr, load the example data and metadata that come with the package and initialize the HDAnalyzeR object.

```{r setup, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(HDAnalyzeR)
library(dplyr)

hd_obj <- hd_initialize(dat = example_data, 
                        metadata = example_metadata, 
                        is_wide = FALSE, 
                        sample_id = "DAid",
                        var_name = "Assay",
                        value_name = "NPX")
```

For the Over Representation Analysis we are going to use a list of differentially expressed proteins. In this example we are going to use the up-regulated proteins. We could also use the features list from the classification models or even run both and get the intersect as it is done in the Get Started guide.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
de_res <- hd_de_limma(hd_obj, case = "AML")
```

## Over Representation Analysis

First, we will perform an Over Representation Analysis (ORA) using the Gene Ontology database and the BP ontology. We will use the `hd_ora()` and `hd_plot_ora()` functions to run the analysis and plot the results respectively.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
proteins <- de_res$de_res |> filter(logFC > 0 & adj.P.Val < 0.05) |> pull(Feature)

enrichment <- hd_ora(proteins, database = "GO", ontology = "BP")

enrichment_plots <- hd_plot_ora(enrichment)

enrichment_plots$dotplot
enrichment_plots$treeplot
enrichment_plots$cnetplot
```

Let's change the database and the p-value threshold.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
enrichment  <- hd_ora(proteins, database = "Reactome", pval_lim_enrichment = 0.2)

enrichment_plots <- hd_plot_ora(enrichment)

enrichment_plots$dotplot
enrichment_plots$treeplot
enrichment_plots$cnetplot
```

## Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

We can also run a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using the `hd_gsea()` and `hd_plot_gsea` functions. In `hd_gsea()` we can select if we want to include only up, down or both up and down regulated proteins, as well as the adjusted P value and logFC limits to consider a protein as differentially expressed. The `hd_plot_gsea()` function will plot the results.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è In this case, the function requires strictly differential expression results.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
enrichment <- hd_gsea(de_res, database = "GO", ontology = "BP", pval_lim_enrichment = 0.5)

enrichment_plots <- hd_plot_gsea(enrichment)

enrichment_plots$dotplot
enrichment_plots$gseaplot
enrichment_plots$cnetplot
enrichment_plots$ridgeplot
```

## Searching PubMed for our Biomarkers

Finally, let's perform an automated literature search using the `hd_literature_search()`. The function requires a list with disease names as names and genes/proteins as values. We will create the list, run the search and preview the results.

```{r}
biomarkers <- list("acute myeloid leukemia" = c("FLT3", "EPO"),
                   "chronic lymphocytic leukemia" = c("PARP1", "FCER2"))

lit_res <- hd_literature_search(biomarkers, max_articles = 5)

lit_res$`acute myeloid leukemia`$FLT3$title
```
