\usage{
hd_ora(
  gene_list,
  database = c("GO", "Reactome", "KEGG"),
  ontology = c("BP", "CC", "MF", "ALL"),
  background = NULL,
  pval_lim = 0.05
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gene_list}{A character vector containing the gene names. These can be differentially expressed proteins or selected protein features from classification models.}

\item{database}{The database to perform the ORA. It can be either "GO", "KEGG", or "Reactome".}

\item{ontology}{The ontology to use when database = "GO". It can be "BP" (Biological Process), "CC" (Cellular Component), "MF" (Molecular Function), or "ALL". In the case of KEGG and Reactome, this parameter is ignored.}

\item{background}{A character vector containing the background genes.}

\item{pval_lim}{The p-value threshold to consider a term as significant in the enrichment analysis.}
}
\value{
A list containing the results of the ORA.
}
\description{
\code{hd_ora()} performs over-representation analysis (ORA) using the clusterProfiler package.
}
\details{
To perform the ORA, \code{clusterProfiler} package is used.
The \code{qvalueCutoff} is set to 1 by default to prioritize filtering by adjusted
p-values (p.adjust). This simplifies the workflow by ensuring a single, clear
significance threshold based on the false discovery rate (FDR). While q-values
are not used for filtering by default, they are still calculated and included
in the results for users who wish to apply additional criteria.
For more information, please refer to the \code{clusterProfiler} documentation.

# Initialize an HDAnalyzeR object
hd_object <- hd_initialize(example_data, example_metadata)

# Run differential expression analysis for AML vs all others
de_results <- hd_de_limma(hd_object, case = "AML")

# Extract the up-regulated proteins for AML

  dplyr::filter(adj.P.Val < 0.05 & logFC > 0) |>
  dplyr::pull(Feature)

# Perform ORA with `GO` database and `BP` ontology
enrichment <- hd_ora(sig_up_proteins_aml, database = "GO", ontology = "BP")

# Access the results
head(enrichment$enrichment@result)
